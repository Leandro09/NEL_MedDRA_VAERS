The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.

Concurrent medical conditions included combined immunodeficiency.   On an unknown date, the patient received Rotarix liquid formulation (oral). On an unknown date, less than 5 months after receiving Rotarix liquid formulation, the patient experienced rotaviral gastroenteritis (serious criteria GSK medically significant), vomiting and vaccine virus shedding. On an unknown date, the outcome of the rotaviral gastroenteritis, vomiting and vaccine virus shedding were unknown.   The reporter considered the rotaviral gastroenteritis, vomiting and vaccine virus shedding to be related to Rotarix liquid formulation.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of rotavirus associated acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and prolonged vaccine virus shedding in a patient aged between 2 months and 6-month-old of unspecified gender who was vaccinated with Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis.  The patient was a part of longitudinal, prospective cohort study of children undergoing allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) at 4 hospitals to better understand the epidemiology and etiologies of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in pediatric HCT patients in the early post-HCT period from March 2015 through May 2016. [In this study, 31 patients were enrolled out of which:18 were male; 15 had matched, 8 had mismatched and 8 had haploidetical; 8 had cord blood as cell source, 9 had apheresed stem cell, 14 had bone marrow and 16 had receipt of intravenous immune globulin; 14 had re-admission in first 100 days, 50 had days post-hematopoetic cell transplant, 2 had re-admission for AGE, 16 had total body irradiation received]. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided.  On unspecified date at the age of 2 months, the patient received 1 dose of Rotarix (batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, after vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).  On an unknown date from March 2015 through May 2016, an unknown period after vaccination, before HCT or on the day of HCT, the patient's stool sample was collected. The sample was found positive for rotavirus by RT-PCR. No AGE symptoms were reported at that time. Almost at the age of 6 months, the patient was admitted to the hospital underwent allogenic HCT. 1 and 2-week post-HCT, the patient had diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's stool sample was collected 2-week post-HCT and tested by RT-PCR. The patient was found positive for rotavirus. The patient was diagnosed with rotavirus associated-AGE. [In this study, AGE was defined as unexplained diarrhea more than equal to 3 episodes in a 24-hour period and/or unexplained (i.e. not related to medication, mucositis, or other identifiable cause) vomiting more than equal to 1 episode in a 24-hour period. In patients with chronic vomiting and diarrhea, an unexplained doubling of the number of episodes of vomiting or diarrhea was considered consistent with AGE. The end of an AGE episode was defined as the return to stooling or emesis pattern prior to episode]. Rotavirus vaccine virus strain was confirmed in the sample by genotyping. The patient reported no AGE symptoms 3-week post-HCT. 4 and 5-week post-HCT, the patient reported diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's stool sample was collected 5-week post-HCT and tested by RT-PCR. The sample was positive for Rotarix vaccine virus strain. The patient reported no AGE symptoms 6-week post-HCT. 7 and 8-week post-HCT, the patient reported diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's stool sample was not collected at that time. The patient reported no AGE symptoms 9-week post-HCT. 10, 11 and 12-week post-HCT, the patient reported no AGE symptoms. The patient's stool sample was collected after each week respectively. The samples were found positive for Rotarix vaccine virus strain. 13 and 14-week post-HCT, the patient reported no AGE symptoms and no stool sample was collected at that time. The patient received broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including a parenterally administered beta-lactam agent with anti-Pseudomonal coverage during the study. [In this study, 16 patients received intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) during the study. 5 patients who received IVIG had a pathogen detected compared with 8 patients who did not receive IVIG. 7 patients with pathogen detections developed gut GVHD compared with 9 patients without pathogen detection. 11 patients with pathogen detection developed any GVHD compared with 12 of those without pathogen detection].  The author did not comment on the relationship between the event of rotavirus associated acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and Rotarix. The authors concluded ""In summary, our prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort of transplant recipients highlights the importance of testing for a wide range of enteric pathogens and corroborates previous data that show that prolonged shedding of viral pathogens can occur in immunocompromised hosts. Our data also emphasize that subsequent detections of the same pathogen may represent new infection, as noted in the patient with 2 adenovirus types. In this HCT cohort, infection was self-limited and not associated with high morbidity. Our findings reinforce the recognized challenges in interpreting C. difficile test-positive results in high-risk hosts with, and without, associated symptomatology. Despite the small nature of this pilot study, these data will inform further design and direction of AGE studies that can more precisely assess the etiology of AGE in this vulnerable population.""

I looked in the mirror and could see the left lower part of my face (lower cheek by the edge of my mouth) swell and my right upper lip started to swell. I took a Benadryl (25mg oral tablet) and my roommate drove me to the Emergency Room. That area of my face continued to swell and impacted my lower lip as well. My lips were numb and tingling and I could feel my cheek swell more inside my mouth as it was touching my teeth. I was monitored (vital signs and pulse ox) for 90 minutes and received 20 mg of pepcid oral tablet and 10 mg dexamethasone oral tablet- both 1x only.

Then I felt dizzy and disoriented... foggy headed kind of drunk feeling.    Then within what seemed like seconds... my mouth felt full so I opened my mouth and looked in the mirror.   My tongue seemed bigger than usual and lighter in color.  But what was most noticeable was that I had Ripples along the whole outer edge and side of my tongue.    pulse ox reading was an 89 so they administered a prescription strength Benadryl shot and told me they would need to monitor me and keep an eye on me.

58487,58487,"It was reported in a published article, that a thin 59-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of severe pain and decreased mobility of her left shoulder after receiving PNEUMOVAX 23 vaccine injection in the left deltoid approximately 2 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. Just before presenting to the emergency department, she noted swelling and redness of the soft tissue overlying the anterior aspect of her shoulder and an elevated temperature of 99.9F. Ten years prior she had received a deltoid PNEUMOVAX 23 vaccine with no adverse reaction. Information regarding which arm was injected in the previous vaccination was not available. Her medical history was significant for asthma. On examination, she had a temperature of 97.7F, left anterior shoulder swelling, erythema, and warmth to touch, with subcutaneous swelling and erythema extending anteriorly from the shoulder to the ante-cubital fossa. She had significant pain with minimal shoulder motion in any plane. The orthopedic department was consulted for evaluation of possible septic arthritis of the glenohumeral joint. Laboratory data showed a peripheral blood white blood cell count of 10, C-reactive protein of 18.1 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 51. The glenohumeral joint was aspirated in the emergency department, producing a small amount of fluid that was bloody with no obvious purulence. The fluid showed a white blood cell count of 12,125 with 84% polymorphonuclear leukocytes; the Gram stain was negative. Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory data the orthopedic department admitted the patient for further evaluation of a possible septic arthritis. Multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left shoulder was performed with and without contrast the MRI findings were consistent with a full-thickness tear of the anterior supraspinatus tendon with 1.2 cm proximal retraction, fluid in the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa (also reported as MRI of the affected shoulder with and without contrast showed only a partial thickness tear of the rotator cuff), and a small amount of subcutaneous edema with no evidence of abscess formation. After the results were reviewed, the patient underwent arthroscopic irrigation and debridement of her left shoulder. Antibiotics were held until intraoperative cultures were obtained. Substantial inflammation was noted throughout the shoulder with no evidence of purulent material. The articular cartilage did not appear damaged. The biceps tendon was intact and appeared normal. A small partial-thickness tear involving the anterior aspect of the rotator cuff was present, with no evidence of a full-thickness tear. Some of the friable inflammatory tissue was collected for culture. Total irrigation amounted to 4.5 L of normal saline. She was prescribed 1g of cefazolin intravenously every 8 hours. Postoperative, she improved clinically in regard to her pain level and range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder. She remained afebrile, and all cultures remained negative. After 72 hours, antibiotics were discontinued and she was discharged. She was seen at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively, with ROM improving with physical therapy at each visit. She was released from follow-up at 12 weeks, with ROM nearly equal to the contralateral shoulder. The patient had a mixed laboratory picture with normal white blood cell and elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Her joint fluid cell count and Gram stain were not indicative of septic arthritis, but her clinical presentation was suspicious. Given her clinical presentation, it was felt that the potential risk of articular cartilage damage from possible septic arthritis necessitated an arthroscopic irrigation and debridement. After a discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefit of surgery, she elected to proceed with surgery. In reporting the case of pseudoseptic arthritis following PNEUMOVAX 23, the author hypothesized that, due to its multivalent composition PNEUMOVAX 23 might be capable of inducing a more prominent inflammatory response. In this case, the authors suspected that the vaccination was inadvertently injected into the glenohumeral joint directly through the rotator cuff, given the lack of a full-thickness tear and patient's thin body habitus. This could account for severe aseptic inflammation of the joint space with onset of symptoms soon after vaccine administration, as observed in both cases. This case further illustrates the fact that caution should be taken when injecting a vaccination in the area of the upper deltoid. Additional information has been requested."

Co-suspect products included Flu Seasonal QIV Dresden (Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent 2020-2021 season) for prophylaxis.   The patient's past medical history included fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (undergone Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty in 2010 in OD and in 2009 in OS). Previously administered products included influenza vaccine. Concomitant products included Herpes zoster (Shingrix) and Flu Seasonal QIV Dresden (Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent 2019-2020 season).   In September 2020, the patient received the 2nd dose of Shingrix and Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent 2020-2021 season. On an unknown date, 6 weeks after receiving Shingrix and Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent 2020-2021 season, the patient experienced transplant rejection (serious criteria GSK medically significant), blurred vision, conjunctival injection, corneal edema, anterior chamber cell and eye inflammation. The patient was treated with loteprednol and prednisolone acetate. On an unknown date, the outcome of the transplant rejection, blurred vision, conjunctival injection and anterior chamber cell were unknown and the outcome of the corneal edema was recovered/resolved and the outcome of the eye inflammation was recovering/resolving.   The reporter considered the transplant rejection, blurred vision, conjunctival injection, corneal edema, anterior chamber cell and eye inflammation to be possibly related to Shingrix. It was unknown if the reporter considered the transplant rejection, blurred vision, conjunctival injection, corneal edema, anterior chamber cell and eye inflammation to be related to Influenza vaccine Quadrivalent 2020-2021 season.  Additional details were reported as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Zoster subunit vaccine (RZV)-associated corneal allograft rejection, in a female patient of unspecified age, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) and Unspecified Infleunza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to Table 1 reported in this literature article. This case corresponds to a case reported in this literature article.  The patient was a healthy woman. The patient had undergone Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty in 2010 in the OD and in 2009 in the OS for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy. In 2019 (one year prior to presentation), the grafts were clear and best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. The patient did not have previous history of viral keratitis or an episode of herpes zoster of any dermatome. No information on patient family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  In August 2020, the patient was vaccinated with first dose of Shingrix (administration route and site unknown; batch number not provided), and the second dose of Shingrix in September 2020, along with the influenza vaccine (administration route and site unknown; batch number not provided for both). The age at vaccination was not reported but it could be between 68 or 69 years at the time of vaccination. In previous years, the patient had received the influenza vaccine each fall without incident.  On an unknown date in 2020, 6 weeks after the second dose of Shingrix vaccination, the patient had blurring of vision in the left eye. At the time of onset of symptoms, the patient had been using topical loteprednol 0.5%, 1 drop 1 to 2 times per week in both eyes. At the age of 69 years, in October 2020, the patient presented with a 1-week history of blurring of vision in the left eye. At the time of the visit, visual acuity OS was 20/70. The conjunctiva had trace injection. The cornea had temporal stromal and epithelial edema, with 1+ cells in the anterior chamber. Intraocular pressure was 13 mm Hg. The patient denied systemic or local infection or trauma. The patient was diagnosed with allograft rejection. The patient was treated with prednisolone acetate 1% 8 times per day. Within 3 weeks, the anterior chamber was quiet, and after 8 weeks, the corneal edema had resolved. Vision at 3 months was 20/25 with no residual edema. Improvement of inflammation occurred quickly after intense topical steroid therapy.  The author commented ""It elicits a robust immune response, with both humoral and cell-mediated responses detectable 1 month after the first dose. RZV is more immunogenic than the older ZVL. It is likely that RZV may pose a greater risk for associated immune-mediated reactions, such as reactivation of zoster keratitis and corneal allograft rejection than ZVL. Identifiable potential risk factors other than the RZV were as follows: One patient had a history of a second Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty in the fellow eye 10 years previously. One patient had a history of 1 previous PKP that failed because of allograft rejection. The same patient also underwent removal of 1 suture before the onset of blurred vision. One drop of topical loteprednol 0.5% was administered at the time of the suture removal, and the patient was instructed to continue his previous regimen of prednisolone acetate 1% 4 per day. The third patient had 1 episode of rejection in a previous transplant. Original indications for keratoplasty were corneal endothelial dystrophy, past trauma, and keratoconus. In 2 of the 3 cases, rejection occurred despite relatively high level of topical corticosteroid therapy: difluprednate emulsion 0.05% 3 per day (for the treatment of cystoid macular edema), in 1 patient, and prednisolone acetate 1% 4 per day, in a second patient. Improvement of inflammation occurred quickly after intense topical steroid therapy in all 3 cases. Onset of symptoms of allograft rejection occurred 5 weeks after the first RZV dose in 1 patient. In the other 2 patients, blurred vision was noted 1 and 6 weeks after the second dose. It has been reported that ""overall, 30% of transplanted corneas experience at least 1 episode of immune reaction.""10 Therefore, observation of a chance temporal association with RZV is possible. However, with 3 cases identified within a 3-month period, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that RZV may increase the risk for corneal allograft rejection."".  The author concluded ""RZV, which elicits a more robust immune reaction than the zoster live-attenuated vaccine, ZVL, may increase the risk of allograft rejection in immunocompetent patients with preexisting corneal endothelial or penetrating transplants. Based on the available data, it may be reasonable to increase the topical corticosteroid regimen before the first dose, until approximately 3 months after the second dose of ZVL"".

It appeared that all subject's recovered, although the treatment for uveitis was not reported. The uveitis occurred in average of 3 days after vaccination in patients without other risk factors or disease that could cause uveitis. This could be consistent with immune complex deposition or nonspecific activation from vaccine adjuvants. Although there was a debate that uveitis occurs because of hepatitis B infection there was evidence that immune complex deposition diseases such as glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemia occurred during chronic hepatitis B infection. Furthermore it was possible the surface antigen of the vaccine and the hepatitis B antibodies of the immune response after vaccination formed immune complexes, which initiated the ocular response of uveitis."

425451,425451,I am a 68 year old male. For the second year in a row I had a flu shot about the first of October. This year I had the Fluad 20-21 Quad 0.5 ML IJG SEQI (Info from the pharmacy receipt) injection. Last year when I got the shot I was very sick with flu like symptoms in the day immediately following the injection and again approximately three weeks later. I also had the usual expected symptoms of soreness at the injection site and general tiredness. Last year the symptoms were bad enough that I had to curtail regular activities for three to four days. This year the same thing happened to both me and my wife (66 year old female). Neither of us were real sick after the shot but we were very sick for three or four days about three weeks out from the shot. I had the shot on October 5th and I have not felt well since that time. I'm concerned about either of us getting the flu shot next given the severity of the symptoms the last two year. I looked on line regarding issue but couldn't find any credible information regarding these kinds of side effects. Last year I suppose we could have just picked up a cold but this year we have been mostly limiting interactions and wearing masks so I am really concerned that this could be something to do with the vaccine. Can you provide some guidance?

In February 2021, X-ray: frozen shoulder (abnormal) Doctor determined  frozen shoulder right after the vaccine.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment included over the counter pain relievers, applied heat and did stretching exercises. There was no relief, then tried a session with an acupuncturist and a therapeutic masseuse- neither helped this condition.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Patient visited orthopedist specializing in the shoulder on 08-Feb-2021, had X-rays and MRI scans taken over the next few days. Doctor determined frozen shoulder developed right after the vaccine. In April, the pain had not subsided, and patient's condition had not improved. Patient took a second cortisone shot which was not helpful. Soon after, the physical therapist and the patient came to the conclusion that therapy was not working. The pain was constant, her range of motion was very limited. There was no improvement despite following doctor's treatment plan. The shoulder lumps/muscle knots are large. On 08-Jun-2021, patient was examined by a renown sports injury orthopedist. He determined that patient might need surgery. He explained that the inflammation in her shoulder area was an inflammatory reaction to the Moderna vaccine. In an effort to avoid surgery, patient was referred to a doctor of Physiatry who will be administering another cortisone shot and will be overseeing next step, possibly another round of physical therapy. Surgery for these situations was complicated and there was no guarantee of recovery. Also, patient was in perfect health before this vaccine and it is evident that she was suffering a reaction to the Moderna vaccine.

The course of events was as follows: After she got the first dose she had some adverse reactions in 2021: she had pain all over body, chest pain, leg pain, severe pain on her neck, that she couldn't lift her head. She has seen some specialists to seek assistance, she has seen a hematologist, and a rheumatologist. She has been on steroids and she was not yet done with the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Her doctor was very aware. When this started 3 months before, she 110 lbs but she has been taking steroids and her weight has shot up like crazy now she is 120 lbs, she told her doctor that she had no more fat clothes she will have to get off of the steroids, they blame everything on steroids.

199167,199167,"This medically confirmed literature report (initial receipt 23-Feb-2016) concerns a 60-year old female patient who developed acute-onset massive proteinuria with NS (nephrotic syndrome) and severe AKI (acute kidney injury) soon after receiving the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. The patient had medical history of bronchial asthma and there was no history of drug allergy. Her medications included montelukast, salbutamol and SERETIDE. She denied use of any other medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal medications. There was no history of diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis or blood transfusion. She denied smoking, alcohol or intravenous drug use. She was referred to the emergency room (ER) by her primary medical doctor (PMD) for evaluation of elevated serum creatinine level (10.3 mg/ dL). The patient was seen by her PMD one day before her ER visit for evaluation of worsening bilateral lower extremity edema. She had received the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine two weeks before her ER presentation. The patient developed fever, intermittent nausea and vomiting and lower extremity edema soon after being immunized with the influenza vaccine. She had refused influenza vaccination in the past as her father died from GB syndrome after receiving influenza vaccine. Review of systems was negative for sore throat, dyspnea, gross hematuria, arthralgias or rash. On physical examination, her blood pressure was elevated at 220/100 mm Hg and there was 3+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. She was afebrile in the ER. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. At the time of ER presentation, the serum creatinine was elevated at 9.93 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen was 77 mg/dL. The serum creatinine checked three months before presentation to the ER was 0.9 mg/dL. The serum total protein was 7.8 g/dL and serum albumin was low (2.3 g/dL). Because of the high globulin fraction, serum immunofixation was performed, which revealed polyclonal gammopathy but no monoclonal immunoglobulin was seen. Repeat laboratory testing performed subsequently revealed a total protein level of 4.5 g/dL and serum albumin of 2.2 g/dL. Aspartate aminotransferase was mildly elevated (49 U/L). Other liver enzymes were within normal limits. Complete blood count was normal. Urinalysis was significant for 20-30 WBC/hpf, 10-20 RBC/hpf and 3+ proteinuria. Her random urine total protein to creatinine (TP/CR) ratio was significantly elevated at 22. A 24-h urine collection revealed 20.5 g of protein. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis in the ER revealed no hydronephrosis or peri-nephric inflammatory changes. Chest X-ray was normal. Workup for secondary causes of the NS and AKI revealed non-reactive hepatitis C virus antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen. The antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), cryoglobulins, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody were all negative. The serum complement levels were normal. A CT scan-guided kidney biopsy was subsequently performed. Kidney biopsy findings: Eight glomeruli were identified on light microscopic examination of the kidney biopsy specimen. The glomeruli showed patent capillary loops and urinary spaces. The interstitium showed patchy edema and mild to moderate inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of mononuclear cells with many eosinophils. The arteries showed mild intimal sclerosis without vasculitis. Immunofluorescence showed scattered fine granular staining for IgG, C3, kappa and lambda light chains in the outer aspect of the glomerular capillary wall. Electron microscopy showed scattered electron dense deposits in the subepithelial and intramembranous locations. Extensive effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes was seen. The kidney biopsy findings were consistent with (stage 1) MN and AIN. Clinical follow-up: The patient was initially started on furosemide and metolazone for management of edema. She was also started on amlodipine and clonidine for management of hypertension. The BP was well controlled with the above medications. She was responding well to the diuretic therapy and had no uremic symptoms, she was not dialyzed. After reviewing the results of the kidney biopsy, the patient was initiated on daily oral prednisone (0.75 mg/kg) with tapering doses over the next 2.5 months. The serum creatinine normalized (1.04 mg/dL) five weeks after initiation of oral prednisone. The serum albumin normalized (3.7 g/dL) after seven weeks, while spot urine TP/CR decreased dramatically to 1.3 after nine weeks of oral corticosteroid therapy. However, one week after completion of prednisone therapy, the patient presented to the office with bilateral lower extremity swelling and 30 pounds weight gain. Laboratory tests performed during that office visit revealed a low serum albumin level of 2.1 g/dL and an elevated serum creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. The total cholesterol (417 mg/dL) and triglyceride (608 mg/ dL) levels were also elevated. Her spot urine TP/CR increased significantly to 28. The patient was hospitalized for management of worsening edema. Repeat kidney biopsy performed during her hospital stay revealed rare subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy with a varied degree of translucency suggestive of resorption of previous deposits. There was no evidence of AIN on repeat kidney biopsy. The patient was reinitiated on daily oral prednisone (0.75 mg/kg) soon after reviewing the biopsy results. Prednisone was gradually tapered over the next four months. Two weeks after reinitiation of corticosteroids, her serum creatinine decreased to the normal range (0.88 mg/dL), her serum albumin increased to 3.5 g/dL and spot urine TP/CR decreased to 2.2. Serum albumin improved further to 4.1 g/dL after one month of oral prednisone therapy. Proteinuria continued to decline and spot urine TP/CR normalized (0.2) two weeks after completion of the second course of oral corticosteroid therapy. Since then, the patient has refused further influenza vaccinations. At the five-year follow-up, our patient continues to remain in complete clinical remission of the NS (spot urine TP/CR of 0.1) with normal renal function (serum creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL). Linked to case: 2016059464 (same reporter). Reporter comments: We present a case of MN and severe AKI following the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination. Optimal therapy of influenza vaccine-associated glomerular diseases including MN is unknown. Our patient remains in clinical remission with normal renal function, five years after completion of corticosteroid therapy. Based on our experience, one can consider corticosteroid therapy in patients with MN and AIN following influenza vaccination. However, further studies are required to investigate the exact pathogenesis of influenza vaccine-induced MN. Sender's Comments: Company's evaluation and comment: Seriousness criterion/criteria: Medically significant. Listedness: Unlisted. Assessment according to the CCDS for CSL's H1N1 Influenza Vaccine, nephrotic syndrome and all other events are unlisted except fever, nausea and vomiting which are listed. Company Causality: Possible. There was a plausible temporal relationship of 2 weeks for onset of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with nephrotic syndrome.  No other risk causative or risk factors such as NSAIDS use, diabetes, hypertension, connective tissue disease and or HIV infection. Vasculitis with transient renal involvement is a known adverse event with Influenza vaccination in general including H1N1. In concurrence with the authors, although the exact pathogenesis of MN following influenza vaccination is not known, it is possible for autoimmune mediate damage to have occurred by either auto-antibody and or small circulating immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane  induced as an immunologically mediated vaccination response."

Insomnia, inability to focus on things directly in front of me (a hand in front of my face would go out of focus automatically after a second), blurred vision, short term/long term memory loss, severe emotional issues, difficulty breathing, anxiety. Shortness of breath at a certain point was so bad I thought I was not going to make it. One very troublesome symptom that culminated after weeks of 4 hours of sleep was that my brain started feeling ""funny"". The best way to describe it was a brain ""orgasm"" which I have never experienced before. At the same time I experienced dry heaving for several minutes, and severe shortness of breath. After this experience my symptoms gradually improved over the next week or two. Prior to this it felt like my brain was not getting enough oxygen/blood, which could have been feeding my insomnia. When I would try to sleep, I would wake up at 4 am gasping for air, as I felt like my breathing was labored when sleeping. I could not focus on my computer screen to do my job at home. Large amounts of melatonin seemed to help my brain feel better and get some rest. I took hydroxyzine for unrelated reasons prior to the vaccine injection as needed, however not too often. During  March I did not take it, as I had experienced disruptions in circadian rhythm due to the medication. I feel it is possible I had a blood clot that has been described in the news, although now there may be no way to know for sure. I talked with  my primary care physician about this, and he did not think this was the case because I was male. However I have a BMI of 18.7 and some issues females have such as TMJ and inability gain weight/anorexia diagnosis when younger. I also was recently diagnosed with an only recently described actual medical issue called R-CPD, which is the complete inability to burp or belch. I felt like during the time when I experienced the side effects, that this condition was heightened (bloating/loss of appetite). I lost quite a bit of weight during March, I usually weigh 135-140, and was down to 115 at a certain point. I am now back up to 130.   I now take sertraline at 1/4 pill dosage to treat the anxiety I experienced as a result of these symptoms as well as some other personal issues.

218839,218839,"This literature report was received from the authors of a published literature article concerning a 49 year old patient of unknown gender who was classified to be a Reinfected Case (RIC). On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with the third dose of M-M-R II (route and lot # not reported). Despite the continued importations of measles virus into the article country, the elimination of indigenous measles had been maintained for over 15 years because of sustained high coverage with two doses of M-M-R II. Many countries have eliminated measles or have made significant progress toward achieving goals for measles elimination. However, measles remained endemic in many parts of the world and both sporadic cases and large outbreaks have occurred in this country following importations of the virus. Although most measles cases in the country have occurred among unvaccinated individuals, some confirmed cases have occurred among vaccinated and presumptively immune individuals. A suspected measles case in a previously vaccinated individual could be classified as a primary vaccine failure (PVF) by measurement of low-avidity measles IgG antibody. Individuals with confirmed measles and a prior immunologic response to measles virus (reinfection) from either vaccination or natural disease that occurred at least 4 months before symptom onset can be identified by the presence of high-avidity measles IgG antibody. A measles virus reinfection that occurs in an individual who had measurable specific antibodies after documented vaccination constitutes a secondary vaccine failure (SVF). However, the vaccination history of some persons with confirmed reinfections could be unknown, and among those with higher or equal to 1 documented doses of vaccine, evidence of a protective titer of antibody to measles following vaccination is rarely available. Therefore, the term reinfection case (RIC) can be universally applied to a confirmed measles case in a person with high-avidity measles IgG antibody. In this study, persons suspected of having measles with high avidity measles IgG antibody in serum were tested by standard laboratory methods and were classified as having either a RIC or a rash illness not attributable to measles (noncase). On an unknown date, the patient was reported to have had no detectable IgG despite the receipt of three doses of M-M-R II vaccine. It was reported that the IgG concentrations in this reinfected case increased rapidly after rash onset and reached peak titers before 10 days after rash onset. Between 1 and 2 months after rash onset, the elevated concentrations had fallen below 40,000 mIU/mL. In conclusion, although high coverage with two doses of M-M-R II vaccine has eliminated measles, vaccination may fail to stimulate a protective level of antibody in some individuals, even after two doses of M-M-R II. Additional information has been requested."

The following is verbatim from the article: Background. Reporting of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination can help identify rare or unexpected complications of immunizations and aid in characterizing potential vaccine safety signals.We developed an open-source, generalizable clinical decision support system called Electronic Support for Public Health-Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (ESP-VAERS) to assist clinicians with AE detection and reporting. Methods. ESP-VAERS monitors patients' electronic health records for new diagnoses, changes in laboratory values and new allergies following vaccinations. When suggestive events are found, ESP-VAERS sends the patient's clinician a secure electronic message with an invitation to affirm or refute the message, add comments, and submit an automated, prepopulated electronic report to VAERS. High-probability AEs are reported automatically if the clinician does not respond. We implemented ESP-VAERS in December 2012 throughout the Health System, an integrated healthcare system. We queried the VAERS database to determine Health's baseline reporting rates from January 2009 to March 2012 and then assessed changes in reporting rates with ESP-VAERS. Results. In the 8 months following implementation, 91 622 vaccinations were given. ESP-VAERS sent 1385 messages to responsible clinicians describing potential AEs. Clinicians opened 1304 (94.2 percent) messages, responded to 209 (15.1 percent), and confirmed 16 for transmission to VAERS. An additional 16 high-probability AEs were sent automatically. Reported events included seizure, pleural effusion, and lymphocytopenia. The odds of a VAERS report submission during the implementation period were 30.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 9.52-95.5) times greater than the odds during the comparable preimplementation period. Conclusions. An open-source, electronic health record-based clinical decision support system can increase AE detection and reporting rates in VAERS. Keywords. Vaccine; immunization; adverse reaction; reporting; adverse event. This case involves patient (age and gender not reported), who was vaccinated with a dose of IIV and a dose of TDAP (Manufacturer: unknown, batch number, route, dose in series and site of administration of both were not reported) both on an unspecified date.
